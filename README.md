# Development of a Dual-Input Neural Model for Detecting AI-Generated Imagery
## William Pugsley, Jonathan Gallagher, Somayeh Fouladi

Over the past years, images generated by artificial
intelligence have become more prevalent and more realistic. Their
advent raises ethical questions relating to misinformation, artistic
expression, and identity theft, among others. The crux of many of
these moral questions is the difficulty in distinguishing between
real and fake images. It is important to develop tools that are able
to detect AI-generated images, especially when these images are
too realistic-looking for the human eye to identify as fake. This
paper proposes a dual-branch neural network architecture that
takes both images and their Fourier frequency decomposition as
inputs. We use standard CNN-based methods for both branches
as described in Stuchi et al. [7], followed by fully-connected
layers. Our proposed model achieves an accuracy of 94% on
the CIFAKE dataset, which significantly outperforms classic ML
methods and CNNs, achieving performance comparable to some
state-of-the-art architectures, such as ResNet.
